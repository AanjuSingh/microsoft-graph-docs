# Get change notifications for Microsoft Teams Presence updates

Change notifications in Microsoft Graph enable you to subscribe to the Teams presence information of your own and other users. Change notifications provide a low-latency model by allowing you to maintain a subscription. You can also get the resource data in the notifications and therefore avoid calling the API to get the payload.
This is an alternative to polling for presence by using the [GET presence](../api-reference/v1.0/api/presence-get) and [POST getPresencesByUserId](../api-reference/v1.0/api/cloudcommunications-getpresencesbyuserid) APIs.

1. Subscribe to a single userâ€™s presence through the /communications/presences/{id} path.

2. Subscribe to a maximum number of 650 users by using /communications/presences?$filter=id in ({id},{id}...). The {id} represents a user ID GUID.

Subscriptions expire every hour and must be renewed.

This resource supports notifications with resource data. For more information about setting up notifications with resource data, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data).
