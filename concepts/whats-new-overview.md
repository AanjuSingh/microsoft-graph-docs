# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.


## October 2021: New and generally available

### Cloud communications | Calls
- [Transfer](/graph/api/call-transfer) an active peer-to-peer call.
- Transfer a group call to a specified participant (transferee).

### Cloud communications | Online meetings
Support multiple toll and toll-free numbers for dial-in phone access ([audio conferencing](/graph/api/resources/audioConferencing)) of an [online meeting](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeeting).

<!-- Hold off until permissions are deployed
As part of [privacy management in Microsoft 365](/privacy/solutions/privacymanagement/privacy-management?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true), subject rights request now debuts in both v1 and beta endpoints of Microsoft Graph. The [subject rights request API](/graph/api/resources/subjectrightsrequest) lets users make requests to review or manage their personal data in their organizations. It also lets organizations automate and scale managing these requests, helping them to meet industry regulations more efficiently.

## September 2021: New and generally available

### Cloud communications | Calls
- Put a [participant](/graph/api/resources/participant) on hold and play music in the background, by using the [startHoldMusic](/graph/api/participant-startHoldMusic) action.

### Devices and apps | Cloud printing
Cloud printer status includes all the standard values in [Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipp-registrations/ipp-registrations.xhtml).

### Devices and apps | Corporate management
Intune monthly updates for the v1.0 version. In the [changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog), set the **Date** filter for September, 2021, and look for a section with this same heading.

### Files
- Get the details of any virus detected in a [driveItem](/graph/api/resources/driveItem) through a **malware** property.
- Use the [delta](/graph/api/driveitem-delta) function to track changes on not only the root folder but also other folders within a drive.

### Identity and access | Directory management
Providers of role-based access control (RBAC) can [manage roles](/graph/api/resources/rolemanagement) in Azure Active Directory, by [defining role actions](/graph/api/resources/unifiedroledefinition) that can be performed on specific resources, and [assigning roles](/graph/api/resources/unifiedroleassignment) to users based on such role definitions, giving them the corresponding access to those resources.

### Search | Query
- Aggregate numeric or string type search results that are imported by [Microsoft Graph connectors](/microsoftsearch/connectors-overview) and that are set to be refinable in the [schema](/graph/api/resources/schema). See more information about [refining search results using aggregations](search-concept-aggregation.md).

### Workbooks and charts
Create table rows asynchronously. For better performance, a good practice to create multiple table rows is to batch them in one [create tableRow](/graph/api/table-post-rows) operation and carry out the operation asynchronously. Follow with the [GET workbookOperation](/graph/api/workbookoperation-get) operation and [tableRowOperationResult](/graph/api/workbook-tableRowOperationResult) function to get the new [workbookTableRow](/graph/api/resources/workbooktablerow) resource.

The [create case](/graph/api/ediscovery-case-post?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) operation always creates cases in large format. This expands the case size limit to accommodate a higher total data volume and total number of items. For details, see [benefits of large cases](/microsoft-365/compliance/advanced-ediscovery-large-cases?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true#benefits-of-large-cases).

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
- Allow users to perform multi-factor authentication using a [software OATH token](/graph/api/resources/softwareOathAuthenticationMethod?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). A software OATH token is a software-based number generator that uses the OATH Time-Based One Time Password (TOTP) standard.

- Use [B2C user flow](/graph/api/resources/b2cidentityuserflow?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and [self-service sign-up user flow](/graph/api/resources/b2xidentityuserflow?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) in favor of the earlier [user flow](/graph/api/resources/identityuserflow?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) API, which has been deprecated.

### Security | Attack simulation and training
Debut of the API for [attack simulation and training](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/attack-simulation-training?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true), which is a service available as part of [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/defender-for-office-365?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true). The API enables tenant administrators to [list launched simulation exercises and trainings](/graph/api/attacksimulationroot-list-simulations?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), and get [reports](/graph/api/resources/report-m365defender-reports-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) on derived insights into online behaviors of users in the phishing simulations.
