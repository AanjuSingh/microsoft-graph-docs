# Create education assignments for web application with links to user website

Education institutions have custom tools that needs data from Assignments and Grades, e.g. tools that are used for reporting and communication to the school district, or tools that are used to automate a set of process. You can get data for assignments and grades for both classes and students.

## Use share to teams feature

Share to Teams is a button enabled on any web app, that allows users to share content to other users in Teams. Follow these two steps to add share to teams assignments to your website

- Add a launcher to your website using the below script:

```
<script async defer src=https://teams.microsoft.com/share/launcher.js></script>
```

- Add share button to your resource page using the below script: 

```
<div
class="teams-share-button"
data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>"
</div>
```

For authenticated EDU account users `Create an Assignment` option for assignment with a resource link of the content will automatically get created.
