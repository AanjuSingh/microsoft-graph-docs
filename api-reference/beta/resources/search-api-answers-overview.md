# Use the Microsoft Search API to manage administrative answers

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

You can use Microsoft Graph to [manage administrative search answer results](/graph/search-concept-answers) in the [Microsoft Search](/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search) experience.

Requests to manage administrative search answers are performed by global administrators, search administrators, search editors, or are performed on behalf of an application without the presence of a signed-in user, identified using an [access token with application permission](/graph/auth-v2-service).

## Common use cases

The use cases for the APIs in this section involve managing administrative answers such as acronyms, bookmarks, and QnAs for an organization.

| Use cases                                        | REST resources                              |
|:-------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| **Search answer actions**                        |                                             |
| Create, update, or delete a search answer        | [acronym](search-acronym.md), [bookmark](search-bookmark.md), [qna](search-qna.md) |

## Supported language tags
A language tag of a [bookmark](search-bookmark.md) or [qna](search-qna.md) represents a geographically specific language in which that search answer (**bookmark** or **qna**) can be viewed. A language tag follows the pattern {language}-{REGION}. For more information on the pattern, see [RFC 4646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4646).

The following table lists the language tags, locales, and the corresponding country or region that you can set in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) to publish a search answer. The **Locale** column describes the language as used in that country or region.
