Create custom roles if you want to define a role that allows any of the available resources and role permissions to be combined into a single role."

The Role Definition resource. The role definition is the foundation of role based access in Intune.

Built-in roles cannot be modified. Both built-in roles and custom roles must have assignments to be enforced. Create custom roles if you want to define a role that allows any of the available resources and role permissions to be combined into a single role.
